# Locking and Unlocking Trucks and Upgrades

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*  
*In Expeditions, these options are not used. They will be removed in the next versions of Expeditions Editor.*  

The **Lock/Unlock Content** section of [Content Settings][content_settings] allows you to lock and unlock trucks and upgrades for the player.

The process here is the following:

-   Initially, we have the default set of available trucks/upgrades and trucks/upgrades that become available after the particular level of the player.

-   If we add the particular truck/upgrade to the map and set the "**Lock**" value next to its ID in this window, then this truck/upgrade will be locked on this map by default. However, it will become available to the player when he/she finds it on the map.

-   If we do *not* add the particular truck/upgrade to the map and set the "**Lock**" value next to its ID, then this truck/upgrade will be permanently locked on this map. I.e., the player will not be able to use it at all.

-   If we have already added the particular truck/upgrade to this list with the "**Lock**" value next to it, then we can temporarily remove this lock by changing the option next to it to "**Unlock**". For example, we can do this for debug purposes, to avoid re-entering its ID when we will want to lock it again. However, if a truck/upgrade is initially available only after the particular level, this will not change after the "**Unlock**" value is set for it.

When you add a truck/upgrade to the list, you need to specify its ID manually, as text.

For upgrades, these IDs can be identified using the game itself or located in XML files â€“ see [How to Identify IDs of Truck Parts](./../../trucks/how_to_identify_ids_of_truck_parts.md) for details.

For trucks, you need to specify the ID of the *type* of the truck, which is displayed in the Editor, in the properties of the truck (e.g. `chevrolet_kodiakc70`).
