# Starting Parameters

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*  
*In Expeditions, these options are not used. They will be removed in the next versions of Expeditions Editor.*  

The **Starting Parameters** section of [Content Settings][content_settings] allows you to specify the starting parameters of the player on your map:

-   **Starting Level** – specifies the starting level of the player on your map.

-   **Starting Money** – specifies the starting amount of money the player will have on your map.

The default value of these fields is `-1`, which corresponds to the default starting level (`1`) and the default amount of money (`5000`).
