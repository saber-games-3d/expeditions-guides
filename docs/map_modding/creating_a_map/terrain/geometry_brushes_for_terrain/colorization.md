# Colorization

The **Geometry \> Colorization** [brush][brush] allows you to paint the surface with a specified color.

In the **Color** parameter, you can specify the necessary color tint.

Below, there is a slider that sets how much this color will affect the surface.

**NOTE**: If the slider pointer is located to the right from the middle of the slider, you will paint the terrain with the selected color. If the slider pointer is on the left â€“ the brush will erase the color from the terrain. If the slider pointer is exactly in the middle of the slider, the brush will do nothing.

The **Set** button shows a color palette for selecting a color.
