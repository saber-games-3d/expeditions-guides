#### 5.2.0.4. Restore version \"mud\" from \"data.stg\": Restoring Mud Data

The **Restore version \"mud\" from \"data.stg\"** command restores the mud data if it has become corrupted. This command overwrites the **mud** file (where the mud data is stored) with the data from the **data.stg** file, which contains all level data (including mud) in the binary format. The **data.stg** file is updated each time you save the level.
