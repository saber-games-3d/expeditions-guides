# Wetness

The **Geometry** \> **Wetness** [brush][brush] allows you to adjust the wetness of the surface. 

The higher the **Value** parameter is, the wetter the painted surface will be. 

The wetter the surface, the stronger the vehicle will get stuck in it, even if the mud is *not* painted in this area. 

On winter maps, hard surfaces (e.g., the winter asphalt, winter stone, ice) will become icy when painted with the wetness brush.
