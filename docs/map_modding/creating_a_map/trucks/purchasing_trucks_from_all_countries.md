# Purchasing Trucks from All Countries

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

In *SnowRunner*, by default, all maps have a limitation that allows the player to purchase trucks from the particular country only.

For maps that are part of the Region, this country is specified when creating this [Region](./../regions/regions_with_multiple_maps.md).

To remove this limitation and allow the player to purchase trucks from all countries, you need to enable the **isIgnoreCountryPurchaseBlock** option in the Zone Settings plugin window, save your changes there, and then repack the map.

To open this window, you need to click the **Zone Settings** button (![](./../../getting_started/ui_overview/media/image158.png)) on the toolbar.
For details on opening it, see [Zones: Overview][zones_overview].
