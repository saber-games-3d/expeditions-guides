# Adding Ambient Sounds

There are two types of ambient sounds in the game:

-   Ambient sounds played *within the particular areas of the map*. These sounds can be implemented using [Sound Domains](./../sound_domains/adding_sound_domains.md).

-   Ambient sounds that are played *within the whole map*. These ambient sounds are described in this section.

Ambient sounds of the second type are defined by the **Ambient Preset**, which is specified in the [terrain properties](./../../terrain/terrain_properties.md).

If you want to use one of the existing ambient presets for your level, you can simply specify the name of the preset in this field. 

Or, you can create your own custom Ambient Preset and use custom ambient sounds. For details, see [Ambient Preset XML file](./ambient_preset_xml_file.md) and [Custom Ambient Sounds](./custom_ambient_sounds.md) in this section.
