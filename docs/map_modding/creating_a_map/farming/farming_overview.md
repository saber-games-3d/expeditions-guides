# Farming

*This feature is valid for SnowRunner only.*

One of the features of *SnowRunner* is ability to create and cultivate *farming areas*.

This section provides all info necessary to create a farming area on your map and set up a farming objective related to this area.

For conviniece, the description of this process is split into three steps that are typically done successively:

-   Step 1: Create [Zone for Farming Area](./zone_for_farming_area.md)

-   Step 2: Create [Distributions for Farming Area](./distributions_for_farming_area.md)

-   Step 3: Create [Objective for Farming Area](./objective_for_farming_area.md)

Along with these steps, the section contains:

-   [Custom Trailers for Farming](./custom_trailers_for_farming.md) – short topic that links to the corresponding article in **Truck Modding** section.

-   [Appendix: Sample Stages of Farming Contract](./appendix_sample_stages_of_farming_contract.md) – appendix with sample stages of contract from Step 3.
