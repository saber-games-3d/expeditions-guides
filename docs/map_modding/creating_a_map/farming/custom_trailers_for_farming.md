# Custom Trailers for Farming

Along with regular farming trailers that are provided with Editor (`trailer_cultivator`, `trailer_harvester`, and `trailer_planter`), you are able to create your own custom mods of farming trailers and use them on your maps. 

Their ceation is similar to the creation of regular non-farming trailers, you just need to add some properties to the XML of the class of the trailer.

For details, see [Farming Trailers](./../../../truck_modding/additional_info_on_trucks/farming_trailers/farming_trailers.md) in the **Truck Modding** section.
