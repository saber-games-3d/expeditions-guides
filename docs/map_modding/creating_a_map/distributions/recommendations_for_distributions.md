# Recommendations for Distributions

-   When painting plants in the **Density** mode, the recommended **Value** = `1`.

-   When painting rocks/debris in the **Density** mode, the recommended **Value** = `0.7`.  
    To make the rocks more chaotic, you can use, for example, the following **Scale** settings for painting:

    -   **Size** = `0.6`

    -   **Value** = `1.0`

    -   **Falloff** = `0.07`

    -   **Autofade** = `false`

    -   **Randomize** = `true`

-   When painting canes (**Canes**) in the **Density** mode, the recommended **Value** = `0.6`.

-   We recommend setting the **Falloff** value close to `0`.

-   The higher the mountains, the smaller the trees.  
    On distant high mountains, we recommend you to use the mature trees, but with a lower **Scale** value. This will allow them to disappear from a greater distance, and then the silhouette of the mountain will be visible longer.
