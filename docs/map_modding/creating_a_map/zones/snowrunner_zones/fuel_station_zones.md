# FuelStation zones

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

The **ZonePropertyFuelStation** zones work as Fuel Stations.

If you want to create a Fuel Station for the Normal Mode of the game, you do not need to specify any properties of this zone â€“ only the **ZonePropertyFuelStation** property itself is required for the zone.

However, if you want players to use this Fuel Station in the Hard Mode of the game, you can specify the price of the fuel (its price per liter) at this Fuel Station in the **pricePerLiter** property.

**TIP**: Along with **...FuelStation** zones, you can also use **...AutoRefuel** zones, see [AutoRefuel zones](./auto_refuel_zones.md).
