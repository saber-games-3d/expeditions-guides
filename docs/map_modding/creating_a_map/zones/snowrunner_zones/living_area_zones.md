# LivingArea zones

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

The **ZonePropertyLivingArea** zone allows you to create zones where the player needs to deliver Cabins or any other type of cargo.

**NOTE**: For details on creating the objective of this type, see [Delivery of Cabins](./../../objectives/objectives_in_snowrunner/stages/delivery_of_cabins.md).

The **...LivingArea** zone has only one setting:

-   **name** â€“ the type of cargo that needs to be delivered to the zone. Typically, the player needs to deliver Cabins, so you need to select in this drop-down list the "**CargoForkliftCaravanContainer2**" type. However, if necessary, you can select a different type of cargo here.
