# AutoRepairAndRestore zones

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

If a zone has the **ZonePropertyAutoRepairAndRestore** property in **props**, it allows the player to automatically *repair* the vehicle. 

No additional properties are required.

**TIP**: As with other zone properties, you can combine this property with other properties (e.g. **ZonePropertyFuelStation**) or use it separately.

**NOTE**: In the Hard Mode of the game, auto-repairing will be not available and this property will be ignored.
