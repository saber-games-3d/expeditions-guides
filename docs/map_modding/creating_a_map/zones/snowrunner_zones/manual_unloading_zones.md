# Manual Unloading Zones

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

Manual unloading zones have an empty **props** section. 

However, they require a specific setup of the location of the corresponding delivery zone and a link to the manual unloading zone in the settings of the Stage. 

See [Manual Unloading of Cargo](./../../objectives/objectives_in_snowrunner/stages/delivery_of_goods/manual_unloading_of_cargo.md) below for details.
