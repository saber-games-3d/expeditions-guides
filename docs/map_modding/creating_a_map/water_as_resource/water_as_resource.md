# Water as a Resource

*This feature is valid for SnowRunner only.*  

In *SnowRunner*, starting with the *DLC 9* ("*Season 9: Renew & Rebuild*"), you can add to your custom maps **Water Station** zones, i.e. zones with **ZonePropertyWaterStation** in **props**.

In combination with truck addons, trailers, and semitrailers supporting water as cargo, the **Water Station** zones add support of water to the gameplay of *SnowRunner* and allow players to fill water tanks of their trucks, store, transfer, and deliver water to particular locations.

Particulaly, there are 3 main types of **Water Station** zones: `PICK_UP`, `DROP`, and `TRANSIT`. They allow to fill the tank of the truck of the player, fill the zone reservoir from the truck tank, or transfer water between zones.

Every type has its own nuances, see topics of of this section for details. For the list of fields of Water Station zones, see [WaterStation zones](./../zones/snowrunner_zones/water_station_zones.md).

**NOTE**: The water tank of the truck can be a specific addon/trailer/semitrailer.

**TIP 1**: As icons for the zone locator of the Water Station zones, you can use `ontarioWaterDropZoneImg30` and `ontarioWaterDropZoneImg40` â€“ for `PICK_UP` and `TRANSIT` zones. In the original game, icons for `DROP` zones vary depending on the employee of the conract; however, for custom maps you can use any other icons from the list for them, see [Zone Icons in SnowRunner](./../zones/zone_icons/zone_icons_snowrunner.md) for details.

**TIP 2**: In *SnowRunner*, starting with the *DLC 9* ("*Season 9: Renew & Rebuild*"), you can add animated fish models to your Rivers, see [Interesting Models](./../models/interesting_models.md) for details.

**TIP 3**: If your map gameplay is somehow related to firefighting or eliminating the consequences of a fire, you can utilize the smoke effect, see [Adding Smoke](./../objectives/model_building_settings/adding_smoke.md).
