# Custom Addons and Trailers for Water

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

In *SnowRunner*, you can create custom addons, trailers, and semitrailers that will allow the player to work with Water as cargo.

Their ceation is similar to the creation of these entities for Fuel as cargo, you just need to add some properties to the XML files.

For details, see [Water as Cargo](./../../../truck_modding/additional_info_on_trucks/water_as_cargo/water_as_cargo.md) in the **Truck Modding** section.
