# Recommendations for Overlays

-   When working with overlays, which are not roads, but 3D geometry, you should not move the points of the overlay too close to each other. Otherwise, crashes are possible.

-   If you paint [Wetness][wetness] on the winter asphalt roads, they will be covered with ice.
