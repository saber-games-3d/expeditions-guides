# Custom overlays

You can also create custom overlays, integrate them with the Editor and use for creating maps along with regular overlays.

For details on how to create a custom overlay please refer to the *"3. Custom overlays"* chapter of the [Custom_Level_Entities_Models_Overlays_and_PbrMaterials.pdf](./../../../custom_level_entities/Custom_Level_Entities_Models_Overlays_and_PbrMaterials.pdf).
