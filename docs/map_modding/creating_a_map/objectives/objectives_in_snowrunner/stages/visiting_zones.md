# Visiting Zones

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*  
*For info on the same stage in Expeditions, see [visitAllZones](./../../objectives_in_expeditions/stages/visitallzones.md).*  

The group of fields in the **vizitAllZones** section corresponds to the assignment where the player needs to visit all zones from the specified list.

For each zone, you need to specify its ID in the **globalZoneId** field (similarly to the goods delivery assignment described above).

If necessary - you can specify the ID of the truck that the player needs to use to visit this zone in the **Truck need to visit Uid** field.
