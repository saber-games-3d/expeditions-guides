# Repairing Truck

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*  

The group of fields in the **truckRepair** section corresponds to the "repairing of a truck" assignment.

Similarly to **truckDelivery**, you need to place the truck on the map in Editor, specify its **Id** there, and then specify the same ID in the assignment.

Similarly to **truckDelivery**, you can give the truck involved in the assignment as a reward to the player or destroy it (see above).
