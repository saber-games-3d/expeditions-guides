# Tasks

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*  
*For info of Tasks in Expeditions, see [Tasks](./../objectives_in_expeditions/tasks.md).*

In *SnowRunner*, most fields of all objectives are [the same](./common_fields_of_objectives.md).

However, along with them, there are fields that are specific to Tasks.

They are the following:

-   **taskGiverZone** – the ID of the zone where the task is activated (by the player).

-   **additionalTaskGivers** list – the list with IDs of additional zones that activate the task.
