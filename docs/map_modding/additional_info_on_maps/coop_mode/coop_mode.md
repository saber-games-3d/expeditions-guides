# Custom Maps in COOP

*Currently, this feature is valid for SnowRunner only.*  

## In Expeditions
In *Expeditions*, COOP is currently not supported.

However, it will for sure be added in the next versions of the game.

## In SnowRunner
In *SnowRunner*, there is only one requirement for a map mod to be available in COOP â€“ *it should contain a Garage*.

All custom maps that contain a Garage should work in COOP.

However, to start the multiplayer mode on the map, you need an opened Garage on it.

This is necessary for other players to be able to connect to the host of the COOP mode.

I.e., until the host opens the Garage within the map, other players will not be able to connect to him/her (with the corresponding error message).

Therefore, if you are creating a map targeted to a multiplayer, we recommend you to allow the player to open the Garage somewhere at the beginning of the map.
