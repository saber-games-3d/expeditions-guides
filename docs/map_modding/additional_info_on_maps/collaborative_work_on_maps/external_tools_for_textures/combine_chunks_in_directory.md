# Combine chunks in directory

The **Combine chunks in directory** command is available in the context menu, which can be opened by right-clicking an object or terrain.

This command creates the `fullTexture` folder within the folder of your level in `Media\prebuild` and puts there all textures from all [map pieces][map_pieces] of the map, building the whole-map-sized textures from them.


[map_pieces]: ./../map_pieces_their_subfolders.md
