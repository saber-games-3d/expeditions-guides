# External Tools for Textures: Overview

All textures used by the Editor are also divided into smaller ones according to conventional map pieces and stored withtin the `data\0_0` ... `data\3_3` folders corresponding to these map pieces. 

You can find them there as a set of `.tga` (or `.dds`) files.

As before, you can modify them not only by means of the Editor, but also in third-party tools that support `.tga` or `.dds` formats.

However, for some textures, you will probably want to modify the full-sized texture corresponding to the whole map and then divide it to map pieces. 

That's what the [**Combine chunks in directory**][combine] and [**Separate chunks from directory**][separate] context menu commands are for.

[combine]: ./combine_chunks_in_directory.md
[separate]: ./separate_chunks_from_directory.md
