# Collaborative Work on Maps: Overview

Both in *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner*, you can collaborate with other modders on the creation of large maps.

Particularly, you can:

1.  Split your large map to necessary pieces.
2.  Work on these pieces separately.
3.  Combine all these pieces into the final map.

See topics in this section for details.
