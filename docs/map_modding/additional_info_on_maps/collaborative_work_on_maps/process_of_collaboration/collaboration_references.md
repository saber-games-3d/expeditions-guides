# Collaboration: References

Data on References is stored withtin the map pieces corresponding to them (e.g. within the corresponding `data\0_0` ... `data\3_3` folders), similarly to data on Trucks, Models, and Plants.

Thus, data on References should be synced according to the general pipeline described above. However, the map of the reference itself should be located at the same path for all modders.

**NOTE**: If a single reference stretches across multiple pieces of the map, the data on this reference will be stored at the map piece where its center is located.
