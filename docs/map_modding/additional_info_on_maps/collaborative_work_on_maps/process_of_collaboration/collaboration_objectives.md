# Collaboration: Objectives

Objectives use settings of zones (names, etc.) in their settings. 

The data on objectives is stored in the `objective_settings.json` file within the `Media\levels\<level_name>` folder.

Thus, when a modder adds an objective, this modder needs to do the following:

1.  Sync all data on zones (see above).

2.  Send a piece of JSON code with objective properties – from `objective_settings.json` – to all other modders.
