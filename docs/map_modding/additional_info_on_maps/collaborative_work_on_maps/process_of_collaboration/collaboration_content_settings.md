# Collaboration: Content Settings

*This topic is valid for SnowRunner only.*

In *SnowRunner*, Content Settings (starting level, starting money, locks/unlocks, custom prices) are stored in the `content_settings.json` file of the `Media\levels\<level_name>` folder.

If a modder modifies them, the corresponding JSON pieces need to be sent to all other modders.
