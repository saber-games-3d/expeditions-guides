# Collaboration: Sounds and SoundDomains

Information on sounds and sound domains is stored in the `Media\prebuild\<level_name>\_sounds.xml`.

Thus, when a modder adds a Sound or SoundDomain object, this modder needs to locate the XML code of the added sound or sound domain in this file and send it to all other modders for them to add it.
