# Naming Conventions

-   Names of levels must start with the `level_` prefix.

-   Names of references must start with the `ref_` prefix.

These identifiers and most of the other ones should be written in `snake_case`, with Latin characters and numbers, using underscores (`_`) as delimiters.

For example, `level_my_custom_map_01` (identifier) for `level_my_custom_map_01.xml` (file).
