# Main Menu

In the **File** menu, the commands are the following:

-   **Close File** - the system prompts you whether or not the changes should be saved, saves them if you select so, and then closes the opened file.

-   **Reload File From Backup** - allows you to reload your scene from automatically created backup (you can select it in the appearing dialog). Please note that backup contains only the XML file of the level, files of textures are not backed up.

-   **Unpack references** - allows you to unpack the set of in-game references provided with the Editor. For details, see [Set of In-Game References](./../../creating_a_map/references/set_of_ingame_references.md).

-   **Create default truck mod** - Creates the files of the default truck mod. The same operation can be done from the Proving Grounds map, see [Sample Mod by the Game](./../../../truck_modding/getting_started/sample_mod_by_the_game/overview.md) section in **Truck Modding** for details.

-   **Save** - saves your changes (CTRL + S).

-   `<list of recently opened files>` - allows you to open them.

-   **Exit** - exits from the Editor.


In the **Settings** menu, the options are the following:

-   **Ignore Warnings** - enabling this option will hide warnings and errors that are generated while working with the Editor. If this option is enabled, the "**CAUTION! Error messages are disabled.**" label is displayed at the top of the main window of the scene. If it is disabled, errors and warnings will be displayed as new dialog windows. Even if they are hidden, you can find them in the log, which is displayed in the **Output** panel.

-   **Show Snow By Up Vector** - this option enables the snow cover effect for models and plants on the scene, according to their texture settings.

-   **Ignore Save Warnings** - enabling this option will hide warnings and errors that occur when Editor saves some files. We do not recommend to turn on this option.
