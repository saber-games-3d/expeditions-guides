# Installation and First Launch

## Installation
The corresponding Editors are installed along with the *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner* games themselves. 

You can find the Editor in the *folder of the installed game*, within the `\Sources\BinEditor` subdirectory.

However, particular full paths may vary depending on the game store you have used to purchase the game, see below.

### Expeditions Editor
For *Expeditions Editor*, the path will be similar to the following:

-   For Epic Games Launcher (EGS) installation:  
    `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Expeditions\en_us\Sources\BinEditor\ExpeditionsEditor.exe`

-   For Steam installation:  
    `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Expeditions\Sources\BinEditor\ExpeditionsEditor.exe` 

### SnowRunner Editor
For *SnowRunner Editor*, the path will be similar to the following:

-   For Epic Games Launcher (EGS) installation:  
    `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\SnowRunner\en_us\Sources\BinEditor\SnowRunnerEditor.exe`

-   For Steam installation:  
    `C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\SnowRunner\Sources\BinEditor\SnowRunnerEditor.exe` 

If you have installed the game via Microsoft Store or on Mac platform, the SnowRunner Editor will be not installed along with it.


## Launching
To open the Editor, you need to launch its executable:

-   For *Expeditions Editor*: `ExpeditionsEditor.exe`
-   For *SnowRunner Editor*: `SnowRunnerEditor.exe`

**TIP**: You can make a shortcut for this executable, if you want to.

No configuration is necessary, you can just launch it.

Directly after launching, you can proceed to the creation of your level, starting with the [Creation of Terrain][creation_of_terrain].

[creation_of_terrain]: ./../creating_a_map/terrain/creation_of_terrain.md
