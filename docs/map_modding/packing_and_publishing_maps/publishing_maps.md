# Publishing Maps

## Overview
After [packing your map][packing], you will have a set of [`.zip` files][zip_files] that you can upload to [mod.io][mod_io].

Uploading is performed using the standard **Add mod** wizard available at the site of the corresponding game within [mod.io][mod_io]. You need to pass this wizard and upload the [`.zip` files][zip_files] at one of its steps. After that, your mod will be available at [mod.io][mod_io].

**NOTE 1**: Mods at [mod.io][mod_io] can have different **Visibility** settings. *Hidden* mods are available to their creators only and the particular people added to the mod creation team. *Public* mods are available to all.

**NOTE 2**: Along with [local testing of the mod][local_testing], you can test the version of the mod uploaded to [mod.io][mod_io]. To do this, you can **Subscribe** the game instance to the uploaded mod, and then **Enable** the mod in **MOD BROWSER** to activate it. See [Downloading Map Mods][downloading_map_mods] for details.

## In Expeditions
In short, to upload the mod in *Expeditions*, you will need to do the following:

1.  Open *Expeditions* site at mod.io: [https://mod.io/g/expeditions](https://mod.io/g/expeditions).

    **NOTE**: To login to [mod.io][mod_io] you can use authentication by the e-mail. And, during sign-in, use the *same e-mail address* that you have used during the activation of the **MOD BROWSER** in the Main Menu. See [Registration and Authentication][registration_and_authentication] for details. 

2.  After sign-in, at the *Expeditions* site of the game (see above), click the **Add mod** button, located at the upper right corner of the page.

3.  Pass the **Add your Mod wizard**. You will need the [.zip files][zip_files] that you have generated during [packing][packing] at its 3rd step ("File manager").

    Please note that to upload a mod to mod.io correctly – you need to upload every *.zip file* of every platform as a *separate file* at the **File manager** step.

    Particularly, at the **File manager** step, for every `.zip` file from the set, you will need to:

    -   Click **Select zip file** button.
    -   Select single `.zip` file corresponding to a particular platform.  
        For example, `level_custom_map_03_pc.zip`. Or, `level_custom_map_03_nx64.zip`
    -   On the same page, select the platform of the file by the check mark.  
        For example, **Windows** (for `..._pc.zip` file). Or, **Nintendo Switch** (for `...__nx64.zip` file).
    -   Specify other fields on this page.
    -   Click **Upload & next** to finish with the file for the particular platform.
    -   Then, come back to the same **File manager** step (by clicking its number at the top of the page) and repeat the same operations for the next `.zip` file of the platform.
