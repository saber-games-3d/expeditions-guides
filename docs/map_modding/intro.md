# Intro

This section of the portal provides info on the creation of **custom maps** using:

-   For *Expeditions*: the **Expeditions Editor** tool.
-   For *SnowRunner*: the **SnowRunner Editor** tool.

These Editors are very similar and, typically, the operations in them are the same or *almost* the same. That's why, most of topics are valid for both of them.

However, in some sections – for example, in [Objectives][objectives] and [Zones][zones] – there are subsections corresponding to entities specific for *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner*.

[objectives]: ./creating_a_map/objectives/objectives_overview.md
[zones]: ./creating_a_map/zones/zones_overview.md
