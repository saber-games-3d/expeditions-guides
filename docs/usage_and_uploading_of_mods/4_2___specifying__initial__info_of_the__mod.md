## 4.2. Specifying Initial Info of the Mod 

On the **Add Your Mod** page, specify the necessary fields from the following:

1.  **Mod name** -- specify the name of your mod. This name will be shown for your mod in the mods collection.

2.  **Summary** -- a brief description of your mod.

3.  **Logo** -- a logo image describing your mod.\
    \
    **NOTE**: The image uploaded as **Logo** will be the thumbnail for your mod on the mod.io website and the in-game mod browser. We recommend using a high-quality image that represents your mod. Ideally, an in-game screenshot is suggested.

-   For images, the minimum required dimensions are 512x288. However, we recommend 1280x720 or larger images.

-   16:9 aspect ratio is recommended to avoid cropping

-   File sizes must be under 8MB

-   JPEG is suggested. PNG is also supported. GIFs will be converted to PNG.

4.  **Homepage** -- optional field, a web homepage of your mod.

5.  **Profile URL** -- web address of your mod at the mod.io platform. The value is auto-filled based on the name of your mod. However, after creation of the mod, you will be able to edit it (its "name-of-your-mod" part).

6.  **Community** -- Whether or not you **Allow comments** to your mod from the community.

7.  **Visibility** -- optional field, you can select one of two options there:

    a.  **Public** -- your uploaded mod will be public and available for all players.

    b.  **Hidden** -- your uploaded mod will be available only for you, team members, and moderators. It will be hidden from regular players.\
        \
        **NOTE**: By default, **Visibility** is set to **Public**. However, if you'd like your mod to remain **Hidden**, you can change this option here. Hidden mods are helpful for testing your mod before it goes live to other players.

8.  **Description** -- optional field, a full description of your mod.\
    \
    **NOTE**: This is a more long-form description that is shown on the mod page itself. Here you can go into further detail about your mod, place credits or other miscellaneous information, and insert formatting. If your mod has any credits, readme or installation instructions, this is the place to put them.

9.  In the **Tags** section (fields from **Installation** to **Changes**) - select options that characterize your mod.\
    For example, in the **Installation** field, select:

    -   **Subscribe** - if users need to subscribe to your mod to install it (typical option for all standard truck mods).

    -   **Manual** - if users need to install it manually (typical option for modes that change the game itself).

**NOTE**: Tags are how other players will discover your content, and you should choose the correct tags for your mod -- for example, choosing '**Vehicle New**', '**Truck**', for a brand-new truck. Or, choosing '**Map**', '**Singleplayer**', for a single-player map.

After that, click the **Save** button at the lower right corner of the page. This will save the properties you have specified and will forward you to the **Edit Your Mod** page, where you can add the files of your mod.
