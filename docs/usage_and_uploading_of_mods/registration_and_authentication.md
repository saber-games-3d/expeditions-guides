# Registration and Authentication

Before the creation of a mod and to be able to access various mods, you need to register at <https://mod.io/g/expeditions> (for Expeditions) or at <https://mod.io/g/snowrunner> (for SnowRunner) and then use the created account for authorization within the game. Or, you can use the existing mod.io account, if you already have one.

However, ***if you do not want to register manually***, the game can register a new mod.io account for you. 

In this case, you only need to specify a valid e-mail address you have access to, the game will create a mod.io account automatically and will send you the temporary code for it to the specified e-mail address.

In general, the process is the following:

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   *(Recommended) **If you have no account at mod.io and would like to create your account there automatically**,* skip this step. You will only need to specify your e-mail address at Step 3 below. The system will send you the verification code to the specified email address. After its verification, the game will automatically create a mod.io account for you based on this email address and link the game to this auto-created mod.io account.

    -   ***If you have an existing account at mod.io***, you can use it for the game. You need to know the email address of this account and have access to it. And, you will need to specify this email address at Step 3 below.

    -   ***If you have no account at mod.io and would like to register there manually***:  
        Open <https://mod.io/g/expeditions> (for Expeditions) or at <https://mod.io/g/snowrunner> (for SnowRunner) and register an account. To do this, click **Log in** there, select the necessary authentication method, specify the required details, and finish registration.

        **NOTE**: If – during your registration at mod.io – you are selecting the authentication method related to the particular platform (*not* the **Log in with Email** one), the verification code will be sent to the email address which this platform account is linked to and you will need to specify the same email address at Step 3 below. However, as an alternative, you can register via email at mod.io (the **Log in with Email** authentication method) and, also, use the same email at Step 3 below. And, after that, if necessary, you link the necessary platform accounts at **PROFILE \> ACCOUNT** page of your mod.io account (<https://mod.io/me/account>).

2.  Open the game and proceed to **MOD BROWSER** in the main menu.

3.  When you open **MOD BROWSER** for the first time, you will see the **AUTHENTICATION** dialog.

    Enter your email address there (the one you plan to use for the auto-creation of the mod.io account or the one that you have used during the registration at mod.io) and click **Send**.

4.  The system will send a new email message with a verification code to the specified e-mail address. So, check your email box and find the email message with the verification code.

5.  Specify a verification code from the email message in the **AUTHENTICATION** dialog and click **Confirm**.

6.  The system will check the verification code and, if it is correct, will do the following:

    -   ***If you have no mod.io account linked to the email address you specified*** (i.e., if you have skipped the 1st step above): The game will automatically create the new mod.io account for the e-mail address you specified. The game will be linked to this new mod.io account.

    -   ***In any case:*** The game will finish authentication and linking the game to your mod.io account.
        
        **NOTE**: The Verification Code sent to your e-mail after Steps 3-5 above is *solely* for the autocreation of the mod.io account and linking the game. This code cannot be used again for *manual* sign-in to mod.io afterwards.

After doing this, the functionality of mods and **MOD BROWSER** will be available for you. Particularly, you will be able to [use mods][use_mods] uploaded to the mod.io site of your game by other players and [publish] your own mods.
