## 4.7. Optional Steps: Mod Team and Preview Feature

If necessary, on the **MOD ADMIN \> TEAM** page you can add other mod.io users to your mod's "team" to allow them to manage your mod on your behalf. This is useful for modding teams who are collaborating on larger mod projects, for example.

To add a member to the team, simply enter their mod.io username or e-mail address, and click **Invite**.

When a member accepts an invite, they will join the team with \"moderator\" access. Promote them to an \"administrator\" to give them complete control over this mods profile, including managing other members' access. Each level of access gives all of the rights of the lower levels, they are:

-   **Moderator** -- can moderate comments and content attached.

-   **Manager** -- moderator access, including uploading files and editing settings except team members.

-   **Administrator** - full access, including the team management.

If you are a Leader of the Mod Team, you can also pass your leadership to another team member on this page. This member should have **Administrator** access for that.

> **NOTE**: Changing Leader of the Mod Team will change the author of the mod that is displayed in Mod Brower. It can be undone only by the reverse transfer of the leadership made by the new Leader.

And, if necessary, on the **MOD ADMIN \> PREVIEW** page you can grant a preview access to your hidden mod to a necessary set of mod.io users. This page allows you to select the type of preview access, manage the list of such users, and send direct messages to them.

> **NOTE**: The **PREVIEW** feature is available for hidden mods only. If your mod is already public, there won\'t be such section in the **MOD ADMIN** menu.
