# Custom Level Entities

*Level Entities* are components of the level that are either placed on the map or used during its creation. Unlike [*Gameplay Entities*](./../custom_gameplay_entities/custom_gameplay_entities_intro.md), they do *not* affect the gameplay.

Both in *SnowRunner* and in *Expeditions* you can create the following custom level entities:

   - Models
   - Overlays
   - PbrMaterials
   - Brushes
   - Plants
   - Grass

Currently, information on custom *Models*, *Overlays*, and *PbrMaterials* can only be obtained from the [Custom_Level_Entities_Models_Overlays_and_PbrMaterials.pdf](./Custom_Level_Entities_Models_Overlays_and_PbrMaterials.pdf) guide created for *SnowRunner*. In *Expeditions*, their setup is very similar.

Information on custom *Plants* and *Grass* is not yet available.
