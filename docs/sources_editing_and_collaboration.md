# Sources, Editing, and Collaboration

In the near future, we plan to open the sources of this documentation portal for the modding community. 

All members of the modding community will be welcome to suggest their changes to these sources. 

Incoming changes will pass the review of our team members and will go live on this portal. 

Currently, we are working on all of that, so stay tuned.
