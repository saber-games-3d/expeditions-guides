# Mod Approval Policy

This page describes the mod approval policy for SnowRunner and Expeditions: A MudRunner Game.

## Verification process: PC and consoles

In order for a mod to be available to all players, it must go through a verification process. Our administrators and QA engineers monitor updates for both existing and brand new mods on a daily basis. Our team members review the mod page content (description and screenshots) and the mod files (the actual performance).

The verification process for PC-exclusive mods is fairly quick. Please note that if the mod is intended for consoles (Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch), the verification process may require additional time, as each platform is checked separately.

## Requirements

All in-game content must correspond to the 0+ rating.

Requirements for a **mod page**:

- **Description** — the purpose and functionality of the mod are explained clearly.
- **Screenshots** — the content of the mod and its features are well demonstrated.
- **Content** — the page must not contain any sensitive or offensive content — in this case the page will be deleted.

Requirements for a **vehicle**:

- **Branding** — inspecting the vehicle itself and all its markings: from the main logo to smaller details like nameplates on mudguards, or customizations mentioned in descriptions.
- **Textures** — in cases of missing or glitchy textures that could cause erratic behavior, leading to loss of control and potential asserts or crashes.
- **Compatibility with DLC** — verifying that it is impossible to use a mod with a DLC truck without actually having this specific DLC. For SnowRunner the similar verification is carried out for tires.
- **Localization** — all texts must be in English (translation from Russian to English is acceptable). The exceptions are stickers and textures: they can contain texts in Russian, but the name of these stickers/textures in the game UI must be in English. Debug text is acceptable.
- **Functional features** — checking that all truck functions operate correctly: cargo loading, crane operations, etc.
- **Test drive** — driving the vehicle on a test site; inspecting the damage from collisions and falls.

Requirements for a **map**:

- **Points of interest** — checking at least 1-2 of each type.
- **Localization** — the task descriptions must be in English (translation from Russian to English is acceptable). Debug text is acceptable.
- **Gameplay** — checking transitions to other maps, completing most contracts/tasks (especially if they are required to open a garage or transitions).
- **Basic playability** — making sure the player can successfully start the session on the map. For example, when starting the map the vehicle does not fall/tip over.
- **Artifacts** — detecting significant visual glitches.

## Approval

Once the verification process is complete, our administrators review and approve the mod.

In case of any issues, the modder receives a message with details on the discovered errors (such as crashes, inaccurate descriptions, etc.). Then the modder can fix these issues and resubmit the mod for another round of verification.
