# Viewing Trucks

Along with working with maps, the Editor also allows you to view mods of your trucks.

This feature can be useful due to the following:

-   The Editor loads the truck faster than the game. You do not need to load the level to view the truck.

-   For the truck, you can open:

    -   The XML file of the mesh - to view the Fbx file of the truck with textures.

    -   The XML file of the class - to view the whole truck with wheels, damage areas, light settings, and so on.

-   You can open XML files of meshes and view Fbx files not only for trucks, but also for plants, the driver, and so on. However, the XML file of the class can be opened for trucks only.

-   When you open the XML file of the mesh, you can ensure that:

    -   The model of the truck exported from the 3D package is correct.

    -   Paths of textures specified in the XML file of the mesh are correct.

    You can open the XML file of the mesh before creating the XML of the class.

-   When you open the XML file of the class, you can see most errors that occur due to the incorrect XML files of all classes that form the description of the truck (truck itself, suspension, gearbox, wheels, etc).

-   In the game, you cannot see the collision objects. In the Editor, they are displayed, so you can check that the model of the truck was exported correctly.

-   You can see the hierarchy of the skeleton of the truck with parented collision objects.

**NOTE**: We highly recommend opening your trucks in the Editor. By opening them there you can view errors that do not result in crashes of the game but can affect truck behavior.
