## 11.1. Opening XML files of a Truck

Your truck mods are stored in the **Media\\Mods\\** folder, which is created in the **Documents\\My Games\\SnowRunner\\** folder.

The full path to this folder is typically similar to the following:

**C:\\Users\\\<name_of_user\>\\Documents\\My Games\\SnowRunner\\Media\\Mods\\**

Along with .pak files of the maps, this folder contains:

-   folders with source files of the truck mods

-   their .zip files (for uploading to snowrunner.mod.io, see\
    **Quick_Guide\_-\_Adding_Trucks.pdf** in the same documentation package).

The Editor uses the same **Media** folder. Therefore, you can simply open the XML files from the source folders of the truck mods in the Editor (without copying anything to a different folder).

To do this, simply expand the **Mods** folder in the **File View** panel of the Editor, locate the XML file of the mesh or the XML class of your truck, and double-click them:
