# Policy on Using Parts of DLC Trucks

Below is our vision of the "DLC content usage" policy, that takes into account the feedback we received from the *SnowRunner* community. Our vision of this policy is as follows, we also prepared samples for prohibited/allowed cases, see below.

## 1. What we do not want / What is prohibited without linking

In general, we do not want cases when someone takes the DLC truck and makes a very similar mod from it, without linking it to the source DLC truck using the `OriginalTruck` attribute. Or, when *some large parts* of DLC content are shared as a mod, without such linking.

The reason for this is obvious: the player should not receive a *significant part* of the content from the DLC that is not owned by this player.

Examples of what is prohibited:

-   The whole cabin of a DLC truck is installed on a new truck, without linking to the original DLC truck.

-   The whole interior of a DLC truck is cut off and is used in the different mod, without linking to the original DLC truck.

-   The branded part of the DLC truck that contains copyright-protected logos or trademarks is used in the different mod, without linking to the original DLC truck.

In all of these or similar cases, you need to link your mod to the original DLC truck using the `OriginalTruck` attribute, see [Modding of DLC Trucks](./modding_of_dlc_trucks.md). If this linking does exist, these cases become allowed.

**NOTE**: If you are redistributing the DLC Truck or its large parts similar to the specified above in your mod without such linking, your mod may be blocked for the violation of the DLC policy.

## 2. What we do accept / What is allowed without linking

We do accept that some small parts of DLC trucks are re-used, even without linking to the original DLC truck. And, our previous history of approvals of such mods speaks for itself (e.g., numerous mods with DLC wheels were approved, and so on).

Examples of components that are allowed for re-usage:

-   Wheels (tires and rims), except of specific DLCs with Tires and Rims that have the [specific policy](./policy_on_using_dlcs_with_tires_and_rims.md).

-   Sounds

-   Bumpers

-   Platforms

-   Tanks

-   Cranes

-   Lights

-   Snorkels

-   and other small components

All of these or similar components can be re-used without linking to the original DLC truck if they do not contain copyright-protected logos or trademarks.
