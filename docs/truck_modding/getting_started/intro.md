# Intro

The **Getting Started** section of the portal illustrates the process of creating new vehicles for *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner* and provides you with quick instructions on how to create a sample vehicle mod for them.

However, it describes only basic and minimal operations required to do it.

Particularly:

-   [Simple Truck Mod from Scratch](./simple_truck_mod_from_scratch/overview.md) – provides step-by-step instructions for *Expeditions* on the creation of a simple truck mod _from scratch_. With minor changes this tutorial can be used for *SnowRunner* too. 
-   [Sample Mod by the Game](./sample_mod_by_the_game/overview.md) – provides step-by-step instructions for *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner* on the generation of a _sample truck mod_ by the game itself.

Detailed instructions on the structure of truck files, attributes within them, the creation of materials for truck textures, and other important things can be found in the [**General Info**](./../general_info/organization_of_files/file_naming.md) section of the **Truck Modding** part of the portal.
