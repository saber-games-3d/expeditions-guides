# Step 0: Prerequisites

## Prerequisites

### Blender
To create a 3D model of your truck you can use such 3D modelling packages as:

-   **Blender** (<https://www.blender.org/>)
-   **Maya** (<https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview>)
-   **3ds Max** (<https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview>)

All of these 3D modelling packages support exporting to FBX (`.fbx`) files. These FBX files can be used as source files for models in Expeditions and SnowRunner.

For our process we will use **Blender**. It is a free tool, available at no cost. However, FBX files generated by Blender by default does not match well with the FBX structure that we need. 

### "Better Fbx Importer & Exporter" add-on
To obtain the necessary FBX structure in the most simple way, we will use the **Better Fbx Importer & Exporter** add-on for Blender, which is available at <https://blendermarket.com/products/better-fbx-importer--exporter>.

### XML Editor
To edit XML files of the mod, you may use any XML editor of your choice.

### WinRAR
To work with files from the [`initial.pak`][initial_pak] archive you will need some file archiver that works correctly with `.pak` files. For example, **WinRAR**. 

However, for simply *extracting* files, without modifying the archive, you can use other archivers too.

**WARNING**: Incorrect *modifying* of the `initial.pak` archive may lead to a crash of the game or the game not working. Always make the backup of it. 

## Mod Folder
To be found by the game, source files of a truck mod need to be located within the *mod folder*.

For truck mods in *Expeditions*, this mod folder should be a subfolder of the `Documents\My Games\Expeditions\Media\Mods` folder. 

You need to create a folder there, named in [`snake_case`][snake_case], using only Latin characters and digits, without spaces and using undescore (`_`) characters as delimiters.  

I.e., the full path to the mod folder will be similar to something like:  
`C:\Users\<name_of_user>\Documents\My Games\Expeditions\Media\Mods\<name_of_your_mod>`

In this mod folder, when passing this tutorial, you will create necessary subfolders: 

-   `classes\trucks` – where the XML file of the class of your mod will be located
-   `meshes\trucks` – where the XML file of the mesh of your mod and the FBX file of the mod's model will be located
-   `textures\trucks` – where the textures of the model of your mod will be located.

**NOTE**: The location of the *source* Blender file of the truck model is up to you.

So, let's start with the first step – [the creation of a 3D model](./step_1_creating_3d_model.md).
