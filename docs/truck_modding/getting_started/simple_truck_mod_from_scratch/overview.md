# Simple Truck Mod from Scratch: Overview

You can always use a [sample mod][sample_mod] of the truck *generated by the game* as a basis for the creation of the truck mod. Or, you can use its components as a reference to look up something.

However, this sample mod is a professional one, has all parts of the truck carefully described, and, due to the large number of these parts, may look rather complicated to you at first.

Initially, you may want to start with something less complicated that covers only the basics.

So, let's create a simple truck mod *from scratch* to illustrate only the general things.

For convenience, we have splitted the process to Steps:

-   [Step 0: Prerequisites](./step_0_prerequisites.md)
-   [Step 1: Creating 3D Model](./step_1_creating_3d_model.md)
-   [Step 2: Exporting to FBX](./step_2_exporting_to_fbx.md)
-   [Step 3: Creating Textures](./step_3_creating_textures.md)
-   [Step 4: Creating XML File of Truck Mesh](./step_4_creating_xml_file_of_truck_mesh.md)
-   [Step 5: Creating XML File of Truck Class](./step_5_creating_xml_file_of_truck_class.md)
-   [Step 6: Creating XML Files of Truck Components](./step_6_creating_xml_files_of_truck_components.md)
-   [Step 7: Testing and Publishing](./step_7_testing_and_publishing.md)
-   [Step 8: Source Files and Further Exploration](./step_8_source_files_and_further_exploration.md)

However, be prepared that some steps are harder than the other ones.
