# Opening the Proving Ground

The "Proving Ground" maps are specifically intended for creating and testing vehicle mods.

**TIP**: In *Expeditions*, there are two ways of openining it, see [below](#in-expeditions-new).

## In Both Games
To open one of these maps, in *Expeditions* or *SnowRunner*:

1.  Open the game.

2.  Proceed to **MOD BROWSER** in the main menu.

3.  If you have not linked a mod.io account to the game yet, then you will see the **AUTHENTICATION** dialog at this step. In this case, please, perform authentication as described in [Registration and Authentication][registration_and_authentication].

4.  While being in the **MOD BROWSER**, click **More** in the lower right corner of the screen.

5.  In the appearing **More Options** dialog, select the **Select Map** option.

6.  In the appearing **PROVING GROUNDS** dialog, select the necessary "Proving Ground" map:

    -   For *Expeditions*, select **Start polygon**. 
    -   For *SnowRunner*, select **SUMMER PROVING GROUNDS** (summer setting) or **WINTER PROVING GROUNDS** (winter setting).

7.  After a short loading screen, you will be spawned on a selected map with the opened **TOOLS** menu at the upper right corner of the screen. 

This **TOOLS** menu you will need to convert, spawn, and pack your mod.
And, you can [create a sample mod][step_2] using it.

## In Expeditions *(NEW)*
In *Expeditions*, along with the procedure described above, the Proving Grounds map can be opened directly from the **Mods Region**. 

To open it this way:

1.  From either a new game or a loaded game, open **REGION SELECTION** screen.

2.  Select **Mods Region** \> **Proving Grounds** (at the top of the screen) \> **Proving Grounds map**.
