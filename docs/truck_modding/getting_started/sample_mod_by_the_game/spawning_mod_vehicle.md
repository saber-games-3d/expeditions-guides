# Spawning Mod Vehicle

After conversion of mod resources and reloading the mod after it, you can spawn your vehicle and test it on the "Proving Ground" map.

To do that:

1.  Click **Create** in the **TOOLS** menu.

2.  After doing this, the **SPAWN TRUCK** window will appear. It will have your vehicle in the **Available trucks** list.

    It will be there under the name of your mod: `/<name_of_mod>/<name_of_mod>`.

3.  Select it in the list and click somewhere on the map. After that, the white transparent model of your vehicle will appear on the screen.

4.  Click the place of the map, where you want to spawn the vehicle. If necessary, rotate the model by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse. Then, while keeping your vehicle selected in the list of available trucks, click **ADD** the **SPAWN TRUCK** window.

5.  After doing this, the system will spawn your vehicle and it will appear in the small **SPAWNED TRUCKS** list below the main list of vehicles.

6.  Select your vehicle in the **SPAWNED TRUCKS** list to switch to it.
7.  Click **Done** to close the **SPAWN TRUCK** window.

Now you can test your vehicle, drive it and test all of its functionality.

However, if you want to finish the mod creation process and be able to upload your mod to mod.io, you need to [pack your mod][step_5]. 

In *SnowRunner*, packing is also necessary to use your mod in the main game (not only on Proving Grounds). In *Expeditions*, you can test your mod in the game even in its unpacked form, see [Testing Unpacked Mod in the Game][step_4a] for details. 

Optionally, you can also [calculate the memory resources][optional_step] used by your mod.

[step_5]: ./packing_vehicle_mod.md
[optional_step]: ./calculating_memory_resources.md
[step_4a]: ./testing_unpacked_mod_in_the_game.md
