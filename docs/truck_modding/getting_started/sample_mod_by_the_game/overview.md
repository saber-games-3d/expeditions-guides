# Sample Mod by the Game: Overview

Both *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner* allow you generate a sample mod of the truck using the *game itself*.

After generation, you can use this sample mod as a basis for your modding experiments, to study structure of the necessary files and folders, XML files, meshes in FBX, and relations between different mod parts.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on generation of this mod using either *Expeditions* or *SnowRunner*, since this process is similar in both games.
