# Location of Error Log

Both *Expeditions* and *SnowRunner* have a specific folder that stores various log information: errors, warnings, and so on.

This folder is located within the **Documents** folder:

-   For *Expeditions*: `Documents\My Games\Expeditions\base\logs\`
-   For *SnowRunner*: `\Documents\My Games\SnowRunner\base\logs\`


This folder contains multiple log files that can be written by different components of the game and in different situations and you can view and use all of them, if necessary. 

However, errors and warnings occurring during operations of this tutorial (e.g. [packing][packing]) are contained by the `LegacyLog.txt` in this folder.

[packing]: ./packing_vehicle_mod.md
