# Testing Unpacked Mod in the Game

*(NEW) This topic is valid for Expeditions only.*  

Unlike *SnowRunner*, *Expeditions* allows you test the unpublished and unpacked version of your mod in the game, not only at Proving Grounds.

In *Expeditions*, your truck will become available in the Truck Store directly after [conversion][conversion] of mod resources and you can try it in any Expedition.

**NOTE**: In this case, the truck mod data is loaded *not* from `.zip` files (packing can be not performed yet) and *not* from `.pak` files (that are available only within `.zip` files for trucks), but directly from the unpacked files of the mod. If these files are incorrect, there may be errors.

[pack]: ./packing_vehicle_mod.md
