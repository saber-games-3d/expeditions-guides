# ModelAttachments

The `<ModelAttachments>` section contains the description of the light.

## "Flare", "Model" and "Light" lights
Any type of light is described by three entities:

-   *Flare* – a point source of light that creates the glow around the particular point. Visually similar to the bright light of a bulb or the distant light from the headlights.

-   *Light* – a light source that illuminates objects and surfaces in a cone of a light beam.

-   *Model* – an imitation of light rays. This imitation uses the semi-transparent model, which is highlighted by the *Light* source. This creates a visual effect of light rays.
