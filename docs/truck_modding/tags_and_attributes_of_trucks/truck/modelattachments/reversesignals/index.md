# ReverseSignals

The `<ReverseSignals>` section describes reverse signals, i.e. â€“ the lights are turned on when the truck is driving backwards.

The child tags in the `<ReverseSignals>` section are the same as in [`<StopSignals>`][stopsignals]. See [`<Model>`][model], [`<Light>`][light], and [`<Flare>`][flare] topics for details.
