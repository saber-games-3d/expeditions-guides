# Ignition

The `<Ignition>` section describes lights that are activated after ignition.  
I.e., the lights that are turned on when the engine is on.

The child tags in the `<Ignition>` section are the same as in [`<StopSignals>`][stopsignals]. See [`<Model>`][model], [`<Light>`][light], and [`<Flare>`][flare] topics for details.
