# WheelTracks

Tracks of the wheels, when a wheel is described as a set of tires and rims.

Tracks of the front and rear tires may be different. So, this tag can be used twice for a single `<TruckTire>` tag.

Attributes:

-   `TextureAlpha="tracks/default_alpha__s_d.tga"`  
    Path to the map of the wheel track, relative to the `.../textures/` folder.

-   `TextureHeight="tracks/default_height__s_d.tga"`  
    Path to the map of normals of the depression depth, relative to the `.../textures/` folder.

-   `Rear="true"`  
    Flag that indicates that the tracks belong to the rear wheels.
