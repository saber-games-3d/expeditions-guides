# XML of Engine Class

This file is located in `/classes/engines/`. 

It contains descriptions of the engines that are available for the truck. Typically, XML classes of engines are not tied to a particular truck, but are common for the particular class or a set of trucks.

For every engine within this XML file, you can specify:

- `DamageCapacity` and other engine damage parameters.
- Fuel consumption coefficient.
- Torque strength.
- and so on.

**NOTE**: You can refer to [Tags and Attributes of Trucks](./../../tags_and_attributes_of_trucks/index.md) > [EngineVariants](./../../tags_and_attributes_of_trucks/enginevariants/index.md) section and its subsections for details on the XML tags and attributes used in this file.
