# XML of Truck Replacement Class

This file is located in `classes/truck_replacements/` folder.

Its contents are similar to the [XML of the Truck Class](./xml_of_truck_class.md). However, the data from this file will be used only when a particular [*Truck Replacement*](./../../new_features/truck_replacements.md) will be selected for the truck.

Roughly speaking, we can say that this XML file will substitute the original XML of the Truck Class in the game engine when the corresponding Truck Replacement will be selected.

However, some data of the truck cannot be changed by the Truck Replacement, see [Truck Replacements](./../../new_features/truck_replacements.md) for details.
