# Files of Truck Addons

In a wide-sense, an addon to a truck is anything that can be installed to it: visual upgrades (modification of exhaust pipes, sun visors, lamps, and so on), functional upgrades (snorkels, bumpers, bodies, cranes, and so on), and trailers.

In the strict sense, trailers and semi-trailers can exist on the scene separately from the truck and are not addons. Roughly speaking, a trailer or semitrailer is a truncated truck, which contains no engine, no driver, etc.

The organization of files of addons is absolutely similar to the organization of truck files. In principle, files of addons may be located in the folder of truck files (as in Mudrunner 1). However, for ease of use, addon files are stored in separate subfolders.

Thus, addons that are common for all trucks or several trucks (e.g. fifth wheels, bodies, cranes, and so on) are stored in the `addons` subfolder: `/classes/trucks/addons`.

Trailers and semi-trailers are stored in the `trailers` subfolder: `/classes/trucks/trailers`.

Individual addons of a truck are stored in the `<name_of_truck>_tuning` folder: `/classes/trucks/truck_example_tuning`.
